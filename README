In a directory with 2 coumpounds to study (eg ligand.pdb and receptor.pdb)in pdb format file,
the programm will create a directory of the format YYYYMMDDHHMM from the date. 
Inside, you will obtain the resulting coumpound in format of "energy-receptor-lingand-X-Y-Z". 
It's not obligatory to have the 2 files of coumpound inside the directory of work.

# To run on a single thread:

$VINAPROCESS/vina-process.pl -r receptor.pdb -l ligand.pdb -c 1 

# To have more help:

$VINAPROCESS/vina-process.pl -h

  OPTIONS:
    -r : Receptor file (pdb format)
    -l : Ligand file (pdb format)
    -c : Cores number (by default 1)
    -h : help
